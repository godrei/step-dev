# Step versioning

You should use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for your step, for example: `1.2.3`. This way users will know if the step version update, includes bug fixes, new features or breaking changes.

Before you would share your step, push your changes to the step repository and put a git tag on the latest commit. This tag will be your steps's version.

When you perform the `share-this-step` workflow generated by the step plugin, stepman will modify your step.yml and embed the version tag's commit message, this way we will be able to validate that the given step version always means the same state of the step repository. Because of this it is necessary to do not move git tags of already shared step versions to another commit.
