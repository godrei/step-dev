# When to share your step

If you developed a step and feel that it would be usefull for others, you may share it to the [official Bitrise StepLib](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git).

Before you do so please check if there is an already existing step, which solves the same functionality. If so, but your step has different feature, for first please try to contribute to the already existing step, by requesting a feature or sending a pull request to the step repository.

If there are multiple steps solving the same task, our users will be confused about which one to use.
The step's user base will be spread across the different versions.

As the Bitrise StepLib and all of the steps it contains are open source projects every step author should be open for contribution.

You can use our [integrations page](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps) to search for steps in the Bitrise StepLib. By clicking the `GitHub source` button on a given step's page you will be navigated to the step's repository, where you can leave Feature request or open a Pull Request.
